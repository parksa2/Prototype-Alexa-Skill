# Prototype-Alexa-Skill
Super simple prototype alexa flash briefing skill. 

Instructions to run: Generate News API key, set up AWS container, download Python dependencies, add desired
search terms and run python program. Wire in AWS URL using Amazon's flash briefing UI.

To update periodically, run the script with cron or anacron.

Ideas for Improvement:
   Set up an actual webserver to take customized search terms in the form of a RESTful data call from Alexa.

   Leverage News API search functionality instead of rolling my own with direct crude string search.
